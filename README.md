<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

You can [download the project](https://github.com/RjayBrown/html-css-forms-and-links/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or fork and [run the project locally](https://github.com/RjayBrown/html-css-forms-and-links#fork--run-locally) to get hands-on practice with the core concepts below. Start with reviewing the code and comments for each file in the practice folder.


### Core Concepts

- HTML - Buttons & Anchor Tags
- HTML - Building Forms
- CSS - Accessibility: Input Labels
- CSS - Pseudo-Classes & Transitions

### Hands-On Practice

**1.** Try changing the width of the input fields (excluding the file upload and color input) to match the width of the submit button.

**2.** Next, the dropdown menu looks a bit odd, so to improve the visual consistency, you will need to modify the styling to match the other input fields.

**3.** Add a form reset button that allows the user to easily clear the form. Both buttons should be in the same row.

**4.** For an extra challenge, you can try styling the file upload button to match the image in the screenshot. There are no hints for this one, you may need to use your serching skills to find a working solution!

## Build a Mini-Project

Once you complete the challenges you'll be able to use everything you've learned so far to build a Log-In/Sign-Up page that is accessible for all users and looks great! You can create a clone of the login and signup page from your favorite streaming service, place to shop, or restaurant. The starter files are in the project folder.

If you run into trouble, you can reach out in the [[üïí catchup-crew]](https://discord.com/channels/735923219315425401/932892279637700658) or [[‚ùìcode-help]](https://discord.com/channels/735923219315425401/735925942559440997) channels in the #100Devs Discord. It's an amazing community space filled with supportive developers happy to answer any questions you may have!
